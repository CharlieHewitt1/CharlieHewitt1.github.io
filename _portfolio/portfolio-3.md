<br>A spatial analysis of libraries in Leicestershire, looking at demand in relation to the supply of services, using ArcMap and Microsoft Access, was performed in order to identify which libraries should be closed to make a 20% saving in costs. Demand was represented by the total number of borrowers living in the output area, and supply was represented by the facilities data provided. The data were assigned weights, demand was summarised over population weighted centroids in the output
areas, and a location allocation analysis using the maximum coverage problem type was performed (left- blue lines represent the output area which each library
provides services to). The location allocation analysis produced a dataset showing the demand in relation the supply of services for all of the libraries; the libraries with the lowest demand in relation to supply were chosen to be closed (right â€“ libraries to be closed are represented by stars).
