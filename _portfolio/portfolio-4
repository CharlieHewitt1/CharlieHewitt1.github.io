<br>I established a research collaboration with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), and reindeer herders for this project. The project collected, cleaned, analysed, and
visualised time-series data of reindeer GPS locations, to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of habitat use, and to identify patterns of behaviour within movement data.

The left plot shows a kernel density estimation plot of the reindeers’ distribution within their habitat, whilst the right plot shows the different behavioural periods of the reindeers’ trajectories
represented by different colours of the line (ρ̂). The plot below plot shows a screen-shot of an animated visualisation of the reindeers’ trajectory.

Using leaflet in R, the reindeers’ use of habitat was also visualised in an interactive tool (below). GPS point location data
and their corresponding densities were visualised and overlain on a WMS map. The tool provides the user with the options to
toggle between base-maps and the data. <br>

This study used R, Leaflet, ArcMap, QGIS, and Excel.<br>
<br>
Discussions with stakeholders established the study’s goals. The study used novel methods, and was the first study of its kind.
