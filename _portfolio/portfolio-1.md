<b>Total Station Survey by Means of Resection</b> 

Using total station surveying by means of resection methods, mounds in a local park were quantified and visualised. Methods used include IDW interpolation and
triangulation with linear interpolation gridding. Left = wireframe and filled plot, right = contour plot. Software used included: ArcMap, ArcScene, Surfer15.

<b>Laser Scanning</b>
The aim of this project was to visualise and survey tombstones in the local cemetery using laser scanning techniques. The data were collected using a Lecia P20 laser
scanner, and the data were processed and analysed using CloudCompare, MeshLab, and ArcScene. The final product (above) was overlain on an OS MasterMap DEM
to provide spatial context.

<b>Structure from Motion Photogrammetry</b>
Using structure from motion photogrammetry techniques, a gravestone in the local cemetery was visualised and a 3D model was created (above). The data were
collected with a DSLR camera. The images and points were processed using Photoscan and MeshLab. The final product was overlain on an OS MasterMap DEM to
provide spatial context.

<b>Zeb1 Laser Scanning</b>
This projectâ€™s aim was to survey an area of the university campus and facades of several buildings, using a Zeb1 hand-held laser scanner. Point clouds (left) were
processed, using CloudCompare, where normals were computed using triangulation method, and a poisson surface reconstruction was performed using an octree
depth of 11 (right).
