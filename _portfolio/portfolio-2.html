Landsat 8 data were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer, and were processed and analysed using ENVI, ERDAS IMAGINE, and ArcMap.

Wildfire burn-scars were identified, visualised, and quantified using Maximum Likelihood Classifier methods for Fort McMurray, Canada (above), and using the Change
Normalised Burn Ratio for Paradise, California. The study compared the strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods used in each of the case studies, concluding that
the Change Normalised Burn Ratio under-classified the identified burned area significantly in comparison to the Maximum Likelihood Classifier method; these findings were
contrary to the conclusions of previous studies.
