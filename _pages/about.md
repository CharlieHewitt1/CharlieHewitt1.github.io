I am in the writing up stage of my MPhil, supported by an Ordnance Survey Studentship, supervised by Dr Stefano Cavazzi (Ordnance Survey), Dr Stefano De Sabbata (University of Leicester), Dr Andrea Ballatore (Kings College London), and Dr Nicholas Tate (University of Leicester). 

My study title is 'Discovering the way: Automated Machine Learning Improvement of Ordnance Survey Path Network Data'. 

My research interests include GIS, Data Visualisation, and Spatial Ecology.
